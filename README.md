## Repository TOF trajectories

In the present repository we perform trajectory simulations of ions in a time of flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS). The simulations are written in python.

Repository objectives:

1. Make animations of the ions' movements
2. Trajectories with differents TOF configurations: linear, reflectron, etc
3. Time arrival statistics
4. Explore methods of solving differential equations
